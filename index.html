        <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio. I have over 15 years of leadership and practical experience in Information Systems development with a background on database design and integration into enterprise platforms.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I'm currently in the Berkeley Full-Stack Web Devlopment Bootcamp program building on my HTML/CSS/Javascript skillsets which I have acquired over the past 10 years. I like to be as hands-on as possible with
            the projects that I lead and manage. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I'm very lucky to have such a colorful background in both business and personal hobbies. I am a US Air Force veteran
            and have worked on information systems supporting everything from aircraft radio firmware deployment to weather satellite sensor mapping.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            My hobbies include traveling all over the world and I race professionally in europe from time to time. My most challenging race was the 
            24-Hour endurance race at the NÃ¼rburgring in 2011 and 2014.
